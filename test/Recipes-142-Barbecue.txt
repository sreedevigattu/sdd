Tangy Rib Eye Steaks

1/2 cup soy sauce

1/4 cup real maple syrup

6 cloves garlic, minced

1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger

1 teaspoon mustard powder

1/2 teaspoon sesame oil

1/4 teaspoon Tabasco sauce

1/2 cup beer

4 (10 ounce) beef rib eye steaks

In a medium size mixing bowl, combine soy sauce, maple syrup, chopped garlic, grated ginger root, sesame oil, Tabasco sauce, and mix well to blend. Now add beer and stir lightly to mix.

Prepare steaks by scoring any fatty outside areas on steak with a knife, (this prevents the steaks from curling when barbecuing). Place steaks in a casserole dish and pour marinade over. Using a fork, punch holes in steaks so that the marinade penetrates into the steaks. Turn steaks over and repeat punching holes.

Cover with clear wrap or foil and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or longer. You can also refrigerate and marinate overnight.

Prepare and preheat barbecue to high heat. Place steaks directly on grill and sear one side for about 15 seconds. Turn steaks over and cook for about 5 minutes, then turn over and cook for another 5 minutes for medium−rare, depending on thickness. Test for doneness by cutting into the middle of the steak.

Turn Your Grill Into A Smoker!

Be sure to soak wood chips in water for 30 − 60 minutes before putting on the grill.

When using gas grills it’s best to put presoaked wood chips in a smoker box or wrap them in a piece of aluminum foil with a lot of holes in it. This keeps your grill from filling up with ash and clogging the jets. If you are using a charcoal grill or smoker then you can just put the wood directly on the coals (once they’ve heated up). If you haven’t used wood before, start small. Use a 1/4 cup of presoaked chips on your grill and see what is does for you. One of the great things about barbecue is the wide variety of experimentation available to the backyard cook. Wood is a great tool so don’t be afraid to use it.

You can make a homemade smoker box by using a tin can. Poke some holes in the can, then open the lid not quite all the way and fill with wood chips that have been soaked in water for an hour. Position the can on the coals before grilling. Wait a little bit until the wood starts smoking, and commence with grilling. Turn Your Grill Into A Smoker!
